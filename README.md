# CityBuilder
Application that lets the user create some building of whatever shape they like

When all files are included in the project folder, run the program. The world screen will display with a green ground mesh. You can create buildings one at a time.

1. Press F1 to create a cubemesh.
2. There are three different modes:
	Pressing 't' will put the cube in translate mode. Use the arrow keys to position the cube.
	Pressing 's' will put the cube in scale mode. Use the arrow keys to scale the building in the x and z directions. The down and right arrows will make the building larger, and up and left will make the building smaller.
	Pressing 'h' will put the cube in height mode. Use the up and down arrow keys to scale the height of the building.


3.Once you are happy with the position, height, depth, and width of the building, press 'e' to create an extruded mesh of the building.
4. The left and right arrow keys will scale the floor linearly. The up and down arrow keys will left you switch which floor you would like to scale. You start at the bottom floor, and pressing the up or down arrow will print the floor number in the console for convenience.

5. Once you are happy with the scaling of the floors, press 'a' to save the building there. 
6. Press F1 again if you'd like to create more buildings. I've limited the amount of buildings you can create to 20 per world.

You can also rotate the world by using the left mouse button to drag the world around.
